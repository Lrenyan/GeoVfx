The data shown in this visualization is based on Gridded Population of the
World (GPW) v4 provided from NASA. Please see the [SEDAC page] for further
details.

In the example project, geographical data is contained in `.geodata` custom
texture files. These files were generated from `.geotiff` files using [this
notebook][Notebook]. You can use Jupyter, [Colaboratory] or your own local
Python environment to run this script.
